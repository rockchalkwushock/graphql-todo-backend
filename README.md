Currently a work in-progress :construction_worker:

## Purpose

Bring my `graphql` knowledge up to snuff since so much has changed since February 2017 :scream:.
This is a playground of sorts for getting ready to build the `apollo-graphql` back end to my friend's website.

> _I realize I could just use `graphcool`, `scaphold`, or any other BaaS; however, my goal is to understand this technology and write my own `graphql` api from scratch._

## Goals of Project

- [x] Understand the flow of `graphql` on the back end. _Getting there still need some more practice_
- [x] Gain working knowledge of `sql`, `postgres`, & `sequelize` as well as find best practices. _Ditto here too_
- [x] Implement multiple OAuth Strategies through the `graphql` endpoint & database.
- [x] Learn how to test `graphql` api. _slow but getting there_
- [ ] Learn & understand how to implement a mail client like `nodemailer` or `sendgrid` with `graphql` endpoint.
- [x] Implement `dataloader` and learn about it.
- [x] Implement subscriptions with `graphql`.
